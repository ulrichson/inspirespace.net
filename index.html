        Thanks for using Inspirespace! It's a personal project that evolved into
        this app. My name is Ulrich Lehner and I'm a designer and developer
        based in Vienna. If you want to know more about me please visit
        <a href="https://ulrichlehner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
          >my online portfolio</a
        >
        or just
        <a href="https://lehner.photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
          >have a look at my photographs</a
        >. I'm happy to share my thoughts with you why I created this app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moodboards are physical collection of pictures as means of inspiration
        to convey a certain direction for design-driven work. It's used by
        visual designers to arrange inspiring user interfaces on a canvas and
        explore the look and feel of an app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside the analog moodboards there are existing online solutions which
        have a similar objective to collect pictures. However, current digital
        moodboards are limited in the free arrangement of pictures. I couldn't
        find any suitable tool that will break this barrier and therefore I
        started to build it on my own. Over time I created Inspirespace, which
        bridges this gap and allows the users to arrange images freely on a
        canvas. The canvas itself can be zoomed seamlessly to refine and explore
        areas of interests. This is another dimension that cannot be achieved by
        the analog counterparts. You will have a continuous overview and never
        lose orientation even when many pictures are present.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future I plan to enhance Inspirespace to bring it to the next
        level:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Utilize object recognition to automatically tag images with the power
          of
          <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >client-side machine learning</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>Allow text-based search</li>
        <li>Support for other media types, e.g. text or video</li>
        <li>
          Optimize it for mobile usage, e.g. touch support, progressive web apps
          etc.
        </li>
        <li>Allow cross-browser syncing</li>
        <li>
          Enhance for other use cases, such as a collaboration tool during
          meetings
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your images are stored in your browser (using
        <a href="https://pouchdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
          >PouchDB</a
        >) and are not transferred to a central storage. This also means that
        you can only use the app with one browser. In the future I consider to
        optionally sync the data to a storage provider, such as Dropbox, where
        only you have access to.
