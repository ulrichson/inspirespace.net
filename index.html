          With this app you can craft beautiful moodboards and freely zoom in
          and out on the canvas. Your moodboard is stored on your computer - no
          login required!

        <ul>
          <li>
            You can <kbd>drag & drop</kbd> images onto the canvas or use the
            <kbd>Upload</kbd> button <strong>to add images</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select one or more images by making a selection on the canvas and
            <strong>use the handles to transform images</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            To <strong>delete</strong> selected images simply press
            <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> on your keyboard.
          </li>

        <p>
          Thanks for using Inspirespace! It's a personal project that evolved
          into this app. My name is Ulrich Lehner and I'm a designer and
          developer based in Vienna. If you want to know more about me please
          visit
          <a href="https://ulrichlehner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >my online portfolio</a
          >
          or just
          <a href="https://lehner.photography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >have a look at my photographs</a
          >. I'm happy to share my thoughts with you why I created this app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moodboards are physical collection of pictures as means of inspiration
          to convey a certain direction for design-driven work. It's used by
          visual designers to arrange inspiring user interfaces on a canvas and
          explore the look and feel of an app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside the analog moodboards there are existing online solutions which
          have a similar objective to collect pictures. However, current digital
          moodboards are limited in the free arrangement of pictures. I couldn't
          find any suitable tool that will break this barrier and therefore I
          started to build it on my own. Over time I created Inspirespace, which
          bridges this gap and allows the users to arrange images freely on a
          canvas. The canvas itself can be zoomed seamlessly to refine and
          explore areas of interests. This is another dimension that cannot be
          achieved by the analog counterparts. You will have a continuous
          overview and never lose orientation even when many pictures are
          present.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future I plan to enhance Inspirespace to bring it to the next
          level:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Utilize object recognition to automatically tag images with the
            power of
            <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
              >client-side machine learning</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>Allow text-based search</li>
          <li>Support for other media types, e.g. text or video</li>
          <li>
            Optimize it for mobile usage, e.g. touch support, progressive web
            apps etc.
          </li>
          <li>Allow cross-browser syncing</li>
          <li>
            Enhance for other use cases, such as a collaboration tool during
            meetings
          </li>
          <li>Create a mobile companion app to send images to the canvas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your images are stored in your browser (using
          <a href="https://pouchdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >PouchDB</a
          >) and are not transferred to a central storage. This also means that
          you can only use the app with one browser. In the future I consider to
          optionally sync the data to a storage provider, such as Dropbox, where
          only you have access to.
